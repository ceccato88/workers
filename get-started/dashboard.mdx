Follow this guide to create a Workers application using the Cloudflare dashboard.

<Render file="playground-callout" product="workers" />

## Prerequisites

[Create a Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/account/create-account/), if you have not already.

## Setup

To get started with a new Workers application:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />

3. Select **Create application**. From here, you can:
    * Select from the gallery of production-ready templates
    * Import an existing Git repository on your own account
    * Let Cloudflare clone and bootstrap a public repository containing a Workers application.
3. Once you have connected to your chosen [Git provider](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/), configure your project and select **Deploy**.
4. Cloudflare will kick off a new build and deployment. Once deployed, preview your Worker at its provided `workers.dev` subdomain.

## Continue development
Applications started in the dashboard are set up with Git to help kickstart your development workflow. To continue developing on your repository, you can run:

```bash
# clone you repository locally
git clone <git repo URL>

# be sure you are in the root directory
cd <directory>
```

Now, you can preview and test your changes by [running Wrangler in your local development environment](/workers/development-testing/). Once you are ready to deploy you can run:

```bash
# adds the files to git tracking
git add .

# commits the changes
git commit -m "your message"

# push the changes to your Git provider
git push origin main
```


To do more:
- Review our [Examples](/workers/examples/) and [Tutorials](/workers/tutorials/) for inspiration.
- Set up [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) to allow your Worker to interact with other resources and unlock new functionality.
- Learn how to [test and debug](/workers/testing/) your Workers.
- Read about [Workers limits and pricing](/workers/platform/).
