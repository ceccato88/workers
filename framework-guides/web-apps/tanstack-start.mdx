In this guide, you will create a new [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) application and deploy it to Cloudflare Workers.

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate TanStack Start's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new TanStack Start project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-tanstack-start-app --framework=tanstack-start"
/>

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-tanstack-start-app
```

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local development server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

## 3. Deploy your Project

You can deploy your project to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including Cloudflare's own [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you are using CI, ensure you update your [**Deploy command**](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

:::note

Before deploying your application, you can also run the `preview` script to preview the built output locally before deploying it.
This can help you making sure that your application will work as intended once it's been deployed to the Cloudflare network:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="preview" />

## Bindings

Your TanStack Start application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using bindings.

You can use bindings simply by [importing the `env` object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global) and accessing it in your server
side code.

For example in the following way:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
	loader: () => getData(),
	component: RouteComponent,
});

const getData = createServerFn().handler(() => {
	// Use env here
});

function RouteComponent() {
	// ...
}
```

:::note

Running the `cf-typegen` script:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="cf-typegen" />

Will populate the `env` object with the various bindings based on your configuration.
