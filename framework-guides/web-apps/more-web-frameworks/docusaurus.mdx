**Start from CLI**: Scaffold a Docusaurus project on Workers, and pick your template.

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-docusaurus-app --framework=docusaurus"
/>

**Or just deploy**: Create a documentation site with Docusaurus and deploy it on Cloudflare Workers, with CI/CD and previews all set up for you.

## What is Docusaurus?

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is an open-source framework for building, deploying, and maintaining documentation websites. It is built on React and provides an intuitive way to create static websites with a focus on documentation.

Docusaurus is designed to be easy to use and customizable, making it a popular choice for developers and organizations looking to create documentation sites quickly.

## Deploy a new Docusaurus project on Workers

<Steps>
1. **Create a new project with the create-cloudflare CLI (C3).**
	 <PackageManagers
	 	type="create"
	 	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	 	args={"my-docusaurus-app -- --framework=docusaurus --platform=workers"}
	 />

	 <Details header="What's happening behind the scenes?">
	 When you run this command, C3 creates a new project directory, initiates [Docusaurus' official setup tool](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation), and configures the project for Cloudflare. It then offers the option to instantly deploy your application to Cloudflare.

	 </Details>

2.  **Develop locally.**

		After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server.

		<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />

3. **Deploy your project.**

		Your project can be deployed to a [*.workers.dev subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your local machine or any CI/CD system, (including [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds/)).

		Use the following command to build and deploy your project. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

		<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

</Steps>

## Deploy an existing Docusaurus project on Workers

### If you have a static site

If your Docusaurus project is entirely pre-rendered (which it usually is), follow these steps:


<Steps>
1.  **Add a Wrangler configuration file.**

    In your project root, create a Wrangler configuration file with the following content:

    <WranglerConfig>

    ```json
		{
			"name": "my-docusaurus-app",
			// Update to today's date
			"compatibility_date": "2025-03-25",
			"assets": {
				"directory": "./build"
			}
		}
    ```

    </WranglerConfig>
    <Details header="What's this configuration doing?">
    	The key part of this config is the `assets` field, which tells Wrangler where to find your static assets. In this case, we're telling Wrangler to look in the `./build` directory. If your assets are in a different directory, update the `directory` value accordingly.
    		Refer to other [asset configuration options](/workers/static-assets/routing/).

    			Also note how there's no `main` field in this config - this is because you're only serving static assets, so no Worker code is needed for on demand rendering/SSR.
    </Details>

2.  **Build and deploy your project.**

        		You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="docusaurus" args="build" />
        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="wrangler@latest" args="deploy" />

</Steps>

## Use bindings with Docusaurus

Bindings are a way to connect your Docusaurus project to other Cloudflare services, enabling you to store and retrieve data within your application.
