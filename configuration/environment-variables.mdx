import { Render, TabItem, Tabs, WranglerConfig, DashButton } from "~/components";

## Background

You can add environment variables, which are a type of binding, to attach text strings or JSON values to your Worker. Environment variables are available on the [`env` parameter](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#parameters) passed to your Worker's [`fetch` event handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

Text strings and JSON values are not encrypted and are useful for storing application configuration.

## Add environment variables via Wrangler

To add env variables using Wrangler, define text and JSON via the `[vars]` configuration in your Wrangler file. In the following example, `API_HOST` and `API_ACCOUNT_ID` are text values and `SERVICE_X_DATA` is a JSON value.

<Render file="envvar-example" product="workers" />

Refer to the following example on how to access the `API_HOST` environment variable in your Worker code:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		return new Response(`API host: ${env.API_HOST}`);
	},
};
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">

```ts
export interface Env {
	API_HOST: string;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		return new Response(`API host: ${env.API_HOST}`);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Configuring different environments in Wrangler

[Environments in Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/environments) let you specify different configurations for the same Worker, including different values for `vars` in each environment.
As `vars` is a [non-inheritable key](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys), they are not inherited by environments and must be specified for each environment.

The example below sets up two environments, `staging` and `production`, with different values for `API_HOST`.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker-dev"

# top level environment
[vars]
API_HOST = "api.example.com"

[env.staging.vars]
API_HOST = "staging.example.com"

[env.production.vars]
API_HOST = "production.example.com"
```

</WranglerConfig>

To run Wrangler commands in specific environments, you can pass in the `--env` or `-e` flag. For example, you can develop the Worker in an environment called `staging` by running `npx wrangler dev --env staging`, and deploy it with `npx wrangler deploy --env staging`.

Learn about [environments in Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/environments).

## Add environment variables via the dashboard

To add environment variables via the dashboard:
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />

2. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Add**.
5. Select a **Type**, input a **Variable name**, and input its **Value**. This variable will be made available to your Worker.
6. (Optional) To add multiple environment variables, select **Add variable**.
7. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.

:::caution[Plaintext strings and secrets]
Select the **Secret** type if your environment variable is a [secret](/workers/configuration/secrets/). Alternatively, consider [Cloudflare Secrets Store](/secrets-store/), for account-level secrets.

## Environment variables and Node.js compatibility

When you enable both the [`nodejs_compat`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) and
[`nodejs_compat_populate_process_env`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs_compat_populate_process_env)
compatibility flags, and the `disallow_importable_env` compatibility flag is
not set, environment variables will also be available via the global
`process.env`. Note that the `nodejs_compat_populate_process_env` flag is
enabled automatically when `nodejs_compat` is used with a compatibility date
on or after April 1st, 2025.

The `process.env` will be populated lazily the first time that `process` is accessed
in the worker.

Text variable values are exposed directly.

JSON variable values that evaluate to string values are exposed as the parsed value.

JSON variable values that do not evaluate to string values are exposed as the raw
JSON string.

For example, imagine a Worker with three environment variables, two text values, and
one JSON value:

```
[vars]
FOO =  "abc"
BAR =  "abc"
BAZ = { "a": 123 }
```

Environment variables can be added using either the `wrangler.{json|jsonc|toml}` file or via the Cloudflare
dashboard UI.

The values of `process.env.FOO` and `process.env.BAR` will each be the
JavaScript string `"abc"`.

The value of `process.env.BAZ` will be the JSON-encoded string `"{ \"a\": 123 }"`.

:::note
Note also that because secrets are a form of environment variable within the runtime,
secrets are also exposed via `process.env`.
